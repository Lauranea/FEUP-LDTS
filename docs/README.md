## LPOO_<T><G> - <jet-set-willy>

A kinda faithful recreation of the cult classic game for the ZX Spectrum, Jet Set Willy.
Jet Set Willy is a platform game where a tired Billy has to collect all the amulets spread out throughout multiple rooms.
These rooms are constantly filled with enemies, and Billy must avoid these in order to complete his objective of collecting
said amulets and be able to finally go have a good night sleep in his comfy bed.

### IMPLEMENTED FEATURES

- **Jumping** - The player is able to jump up, or in the direction he was facing before, experiencing a bit of acceleration during said jump.
- **Collision** - Collisions are an extremely important feature, enabling the creation of well programmed enemies and objects.
- **Stationary enemies** - Stationary enemies and objects are spread out through the house to challenge the player, having the player to jump in order to not be killed.
- **Moving enemies** - Moving enemies provide a bigger challenge for the player, having to jump but account for the movement of the enemy itself.
- **Toilet** - Just like the original game, in the starting room a toilet, which is constantly opening and closing, can be found in the starting room.
- **Multiple Rooms** - In order to provide a fuller experience, multiple small room are available for the player to traverse through during his adventure.
- **Stairs** - When it comes to stairs there are two possibilities. The main one is that the player needs to go upward into a higher area but just walking into the stair, but if the player wishes to go straight ahead, he can jump through said stairs and continue onward.
- **Ladders** - Just like the stairs, the ladders enable you to go upward and onward, but there are two differences. Firstly, as a ladder would, it goes straight up ahead, instead of diagonally. Secondly, instead of jumping to go ahead, you jump to go up, and keep running to go onward.

**Examples**:

- **Jumping** - The game character will jump when the space bar key is pressed.
- **Getting hidden coins** - When the game character hits a platform from below (by jumping beneath it) it will smash that segment of the platform and will get any coins that may exist hidden there.

### PLANNED FEATURES

> This section is similar to the previous one but should list the features that are not yet implemented. Instead of screenshots you should include GUI mock-ups for the planned features.

### DESIGN

> This section should be organized in different subsections, each describing a different design problem that you had to solve during the project. Each subsection should be organized in four different parts:

- **Problem in Context.** The description of the design context and the concrete problem that motivated the instantiation of the pattern. Someone else other than the original developer should be able to read and understand all the motivations for the decisions made. When refering to the implementation before the pattern was applied, don’t forget to [link to the relevant lines of code](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-permanent-link-to-a-code-snippet) in the appropriate version.
- **The Pattern.** Identify the design pattern to be applied, why it was selected and how it is a good fit considering the existing design context and the problem at hand.
- **Implementation.** Show how the pattern roles, operations and associations were mapped to the concrete design classes. Illustrate it with a UML class diagram, and refer to the corresponding source code with links to the relevant lines (these should be [relative links](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-readmes#relative-links-and-image-paths-in-readme-files). When doing this, always point to the latest version of the code.
- **Consequences.** Benefits and liabilities of the design after the pattern instantiation, eventually comparing these consequences with those of alternative solutions.

**Example of one of such subsections**:

#### THE JUMP ACTION OF THE KANGAROOBOY SHOULD BEHAVE DIFFERENTLY DEPENDING ON ITS STATE

**Problem in Context**

There was a lot of scattered conditional logic when deciding how the KangarooBoy should behave when jumping, as the jumps should be different depending on the items that came to his possession during the game (an helix will alow him to fly, driking a potion will allow him to jump double the height, etc.). This is a violation of the **Single Responsability Principle**. We could concentrate all the conditional logic in the same method to circumscribe the issue to that one method but the **Single Responsability Principle** would still be violated.

**The Pattern**

We have applied the **State** pattern. This pattern allows you to represent different states with different subclasses. We can switch to a different state of the application by switching to another implementation (i.e., another subclass). This pattern allowed to address the identified problems because […].

**Implementation**

The following figure shows how the pattern’s roles were mapped to the application classes.

These classes can be found in the following files:

- [Character](https://web.fe.up.pt/~arestivo/page/courses/2021/lpoo/template/src/main/java/Character.java)
- [JumpAbilityState](https://web.fe.up.pt/~arestivo/page/courses/2021/lpoo/template/src/main/java/JumpAbilityState.java)
- [DoubleJumpState](https://web.fe.up.pt/~arestivo/page/courses/2021/lpoo/template/src/main/java/DoubleJumpState.java)
- [HelicopterState](https://web.fe.up.pt/~arestivo/page/courses/2021/lpoo/template/src/main/java/HelicopterState.java)
- [IncreasedGravityState](https://web.fe.up.pt/~arestivo/page/courses/2021/lpoo/template/src/main/java/IncreasedGravityState.java)

**Consequences**

The use of the State Pattern in the current design allows the following benefits:

- The several states that represent the character’s hability to jump become explicit in the code, instead of relying on a series of flags.
- We don’t need to have a long set of conditional if or switch statements associated with the various states; instead, polimorphism is used to activate the right behavior.
- There are now more classes and instances to manage, but still in a reasonable number.

#### DATA CLASS

The `PlatformSegment` class is a **Data Class**, as it contains only fields, and no behavior. This is problematic because […].

A way to improve the code would be to move the `isPlatformSegmentSolid()` method to the `PlatformSegment` class, as this logic is purely concerned with the `PlatformSegment` class.

### SELF-EVALUATION

> In this section describe how the work regarding the project was divided between the students. In the event that members of the group do not agree on a work distribution, the group should send an email to the teacher explaining the disagreement.
